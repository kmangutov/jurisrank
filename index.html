<p>Peter works as a delivery driver for a company called, FLOAT. FLOAT deals almost entirely in the business of delivering packages to its customers. Prior to working for FLOAT, Peter had to undergo an application process. That application process consisted of a background check, personal interview, vehicle inspection, and strength test. The application does not require Peter to have a special commercial license to transport items.</p>

<p>The vehicle inspection mandates that Peter provide his own truck to work for FLOAT. Furthermore, the truck must adhere to FLOAT's specifications (i.e. size, paint color, logo). This is rarely an issue for any new FLOAT drivers because new drivers will often lease a pre-approved truck through one of FLOAT's vendors. The lease payments for the truck will be deducted from the drivers' paychecks. He must also pay for all costs associated with operating and maintaining his truck.</p>

<p>Peter passed the application process and signed a contract to drive for FLOAT. That contract explicitly states that the relationship between him and FLOAT is that of Òindependent contracting partiesÓ and Ònot an employment agreement.Ó Provisions within the FLOAT contract mandate that Peter wear/use certain items that bear the FLOAT mark; these include uniforms, package scanners, and delivery forms. He also agrees to maintain professional grooming standards regarding his haircut and body odor.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with FLOAT standards, the contract also provides that FLOAT managers can go on ride-a-longs with a FLOAT driver, up to 4 times per year. Other compliance checks are conducted for missed deliveries, missed pickups, and FLOAT customer complaints. These all culminate in yearly Òperformance reviews.Ó FLOAT also distributes a ÒhandbookÓ to each of its drivers, detailing its policies and procedures.</p>

<p>Every morning, Peter's truck is loaded with packages to deliver to FLOAT customers in accordance with his route. It is a route designated by FLOAT and can be subject to unilateral change by FLOAT management. He is also paid on a weekly schedule at a fixed, non-negotiable rate. His paycheck can be negatively impacted for lack of compliance with FLOAT policies. For example, if Peter's truck or personal appearance does not meet the approval of FLOAT management, his truck will be pulled from working deliveries for that day. This has happened to him on two occasions.</p>

<p>Peter has been working full-time for FLOAT exclusively for 2 years now; each FLOAT driver is required to work full-time hours and only for FLOAT. Most of the other FLOAT drivers have been working on average of 8 years.</p>

<p>His contract with FLOAT automatically renews every year. However, his contract can be unilaterally placed in Ònon-renewalÓ status by FLOAT without any cause at all. Non-renewal status effectively means that the FLOAT driver can no longer work for FLOAT. Peter has actually spoken with former FLOAT drivers who were placed on non-renewal status for no reason at all; there was no breach of the contract. Non-renewal status is distinct from FLOAT's termination procedures. The FLOAT contract mandates that drivers can only be terminated for breaching provisions within its pages.</p>

<p>Overall, Peter enjoys working for FLOAT. But while he was driving for FLOAT last week, he sustained some serious injuries in a car accident. He was not the party at fault in the car accident. His injuries required a hospital stay and his insurance couldn't cover the full costs of his medical bills. 

He is now wondering if he can get some coverage via workers' compensation. But prior to that, he must demonstrate that he is eligible to workers' compensation benefits by showing that he is incorrectly classified as an independent contractor. He seeks to reclassify himself as an employee of FLOAT. What is the likely classification of Peter's status? Independent contractor or employee?</p>

277 Cal. Rptr. 807
LISA MILLSAP, Plaintiff and Appellant,
v.
FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION et al., Defendants and Respondents.
Docket No. A048261.
Court of Appeals of California, First District, Division One.
January 31, 1991.

Burns & Burns and Ronald F. Burns for Plaintiff and Appellant.

OPINION
STEIN, J.
Lisa Millsap was injured when her car was struck by an automobile driven by Christopher Pence. As relevant, Millsap brought an action against Pence and against North Country Express (NCE) and Federal Express Corporation (FEC) on the theory that Pence was an employee of NCE acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, and that FEC had contracted with NCE for the work done by Pence;
429
*429 i.e., the delivery of parcels, which had been flown by FEC to the local airport. The superior court entered judgment upon the motions of NCE and FEC for summary judgment, and Millsap appeals.</p>

<p>I.


This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Hear the Appeal From the Judgment in Favor of FEC

NCE and FEC filed separate motions for summary judgment. The motions were heard together. On July 18, 1989, the court ordered that summary judgment be entered in favor of FEC but did not mention its ruling, if any, on the NCE motion. Judgment was entered on the order on July 26 and notice of entry of judgment was mailed on August 7, 1989.
In the meantime, on August 4, Millsap moved for vacation of the order. Millsap stated a number of grounds in support of her motion, including the confusion engendered by the fact that the July 26 order ruled only on FEC's motion.[1] On October 13 the court ruled (1) that "The order granting Summary Judgment to Federal Express will remain in effect," and (2) that summary judgment was granted to NCE. Millsap's motion to vacate was denied on December 7, 1989, as was her accompanying motion for reconsideration. Judgment in favor of NCE was entered on the same day.
California Rules of Court, rule 2(a) provides, as relevant here, "a notice of appeal shall be filed on or before the earliest of the following dates: ... (2) 60 days after the date of service of a document entitled `notice of entry' of judgment or appealable order by any party upon the party filing the notice of appeal ...; or, (3) 180 days after the date of entry of the judgment." (1) In the present case, the earliest of these dates was October 7, 1989, i.e., 60 days after notice of entry of judgment was mailed. Rule 3(b), however, provides that where a motion to vacate has been filed, the time for filing a notice of appeal is extended "until the earliest of 30 days after entry of the order denying the motion to vacate; or 90 days after filing the first notice of intention to move to vacate the judgment; or 180 days after entry of the judgment." Here, the earliest of the relevant dates  and thus the last day for filing the notice of appeal  was November 2, 1989, 90
430
*430 days after Millsap filed her motion to vacate. Millsap, however, did not file her notice of appeal until January 4, 1990.
Millsap argues that the July 26 judgment was "incomplete, did not address the issues before the court, and contained a blatant and prejudicial falsehood which necessitated correction." These factors do not extend the time for filing. Millsap's remedy, which she followed, was to file a motion to reconsider and a motion to vacate. Such motions, however, do not dispose of the necessity of taking a timely appeal from the allegedly defective judgment or order; they merely permit a party an extension of time in which to take that appeal. Nor is it relevant that the July 26 order, which clearly entered judgment in favor of FEC, failed to mention NCE. "It is settled that the rule [that an appeal may not be taken from an "interlocutory" judgment] does not apply when the case involves multiple parties and a judgment is entered which leaves no issue to be determined as to one party." (2) (See fn. 2.) (Justus v. Atchison (1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 568 [139 Cal. Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122]; overruled on other grounds in Ochoa v. Superior Court (1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 171 [216 Cal. Rptr. 661, 703 P.2d 1].)[2]
It follows that Millsap's notice of appeal was not timely filed as to FEC. This court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. (Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. v. Rico (1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 674 [125 Cal. Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349].) The appeal will be dismissed.</p>

<p>II.


The Trial Court Correctly Determined on the Uncontradicted Evidence That Pence Was an Independent Contractor

(3) The general rule  to which there are numerous exceptions  is that the hirer of an independent contractor is not liable to third parties for the contractor's negligence. (Fonseca v. County of Orange (1972) 28 Cal. App.3d 361, 365 [104 Cal. Rptr. 566].) (4a) Here, the court ruled that NCE could not be held liable for Pence's negligence because it had hired Pence as an independent contractor.
431
*431 (5) "Whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor is ordinarily a question of fact but if from all the facts only one inference may be drawn it is a question of law." (Brose v. Union-Tribune Publishing Co. (1986) 183 Cal. App.3d 1079, 1081 [228 Cal. Rptr. 620].) (4b) Here, the trial court, granting summary judgment to NCE, determined that the only inference which could be raised from the facts was that Pence acted as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.
(6) "An `independent contractor' is generally defined as a person who is employed by another to perform work; who pursues an `independent employment or occupation' in performing it; and who follows the employer's `desires only as to the results of the work, and not as to the means whereby it is to be accomplished.' [Citations.] (7) The most significant factor in determining the existence of an employer-independent contractor relationship is the right to control the manner and means by which the work is to be performed. [Citations.] `If control may be exercised only as to the result of the work and not the means by which it is accomplished, an independent contractor relationship is established.' [Citations.]" (White v. Uniroyal, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal. App.3d 1, 24-25 [202 Cal. Rptr. 141].)
(4c) In the present case NCE paid Pence to deliver packages to NCE's customers. It was undisputed that Pence and NCE operated on the understanding that Pence was an independent contractor. Pence used his own car (or the car of his parents) to deliver the packages, furnished his own gas and oil, furnished his own liability insurance, and paid for whatever car repairs were necessary. Pence was paid on a "per route" basis; i.e., he was paid a lump sum based on the distance traveled to deliver the packages he delivered. He would be called if there were packages available for delivery, or he would stop by to see if there was anything available. He received no employee benefits and no taxes were withheld by NCE from his paychecks. Pence submitted invoices to NCE at his convenience and was compensated based on the invoices he submitted at any given time. Other than to say "be careful" or to give him directions to a particular location, or possibly to tell him to deliver the packages in the order received, NCE did not instruct Pence as to how to make the deliveries or how to drive his car. Pence was required to obtain a signed confirmation of delivery which he then returned to NCE. NCE gave him a Federal Express Guide and a list of prices, apparently so that he could answer questions posed by the persons to whom the packages were delivered.
We do not view the facts that NCE instructed Pence to "be careful" or that NCE demanded that he show that he in fact delivered the packages by submitted confirmation forms, as indicating that NCE exercised the type of control over Pence's actions as to make him its employee.
432
*432 (8) (See fn. 3.) Nor do we see that any of the other facts asserted by NCE raise a triable issue as to whether Pence was anything but an independent contractor compensated on a piecemeal basis for deliveries made.[3] (9) "When one person is performing work in which another is beneficially interested, the latter is permitted to exercise a certain measure of control for a definite and restricted purpose without incurring the responsibilities or acquiring the immunities of a master, with respect to the person controlled. [Citations.] Even one who is interested primarily in the result to be accomplished by certain work is ordinarily permitted to retain some interest in the manner in which the work is done without rendering himself subject to the peculiar liabilities which are imposed by law upon an employer." (Bohanon v. James McClatchy Pub. Co. (1936) 16 Cal. App.2d 188, 199 [60 P.2d 510]; and see, also, Fleming v. Foothill-Montrose Ledger (1977) 71 Cal. App.3d 681, 686 [139 Cal. Rptr. 579].)
In Bohanon, for example, a newspaper deliverer was deemed an independent contractor notwithstanding that the newspaper company defined his route; prohibited him from distributing any other newspaper or periodical within his designated territory; demanded that he deliver the papers at the earliest possible time; prohibited him from selling, assigning or transferring any part of his route to another; use his best efforts to increase circulation; or follow a number of other like directions or prohibitions. (4d) In the present case the control exerted by NCE over Pence was considerably less than that in Bohanon. The situation in Becker v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1931) 212 Cal. 526 [298 P. 979] is somewhat closer. In Becker, the issue was whether a person to whom an attorney delivered a summons for the purpose of having it served on a defendant was the employee of the attorney. Noting that the attorney gave no instructions to the process server as to how or when the service of the summons should be made, that the server was paid for each completed service, that the attorney merely gave the server two possible addresses of the defendant to be served and that the server "had the right to adopt any means of travel which suited his convenience and was at liberty to act upon his own judgment in making the service of the summons" (id. at p. 531), the court found "no escape" from
433
*433 the conclusion that the process server's status was that of an independent contractor. On such facts as were placed before the trial court we, too, see no question but that Pence acted as an independent contractor.[4]</p>

<p>III.


NCE Was Not Prohibited From Delegating to Pence the Duties and Liabilities of Delivering Packages

It has been held that the general rule of nonliability of an employer of an independent contractor for the contractor's negligence "is subject to exceptions of such magnitude as to leave only a small area in which the general rule operates." (Fonseca v. County of Orange, supra, 28 Cal. App.3d at p. 365; and see Maloney v. Rath (1968) 69 Cal.2d 442, 447-448 [71 Cal. Rptr. 897, 445 P.2d 513, 40 A.L.R.3d 1].)
(10) Millsap, citing Capitol Chevrolet Co. v. Lawrence Warehouse Co. (9th Cir.1955) 227 F.2d 169, argues that the rule of nonliability "has no application where a person has assumed the contractual duty to perform a service for another"; i.e., that NCE could not delegate to Pence liability for delivering packages on behalf of FEC. However, the court in Capitol Chevrolet went on to explain that this exception to the general rule of nonliability of an independent contractor "is based upon contractual relationships. One who contracts to perform an undertaking is liable to his promisee for the negligence of an independent contractor to whom he delegates actual performance." (Id. at p. 173, italics added.) Under the stated exception, NCE might be liable to FEC  its promisee  for Pence's negligence, but it incurred no liability to third parties such as Millsap.
Another argument is that liability resulting from Pence's delivery of packages is nondelegable because the operation is regulated by a public agency. The basis for this argument is found in section 428 of the Restatement Second of Torts: "An individual or a corporation carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority and which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the negligence of a contractor employed to do work in carrying on the activity."
This rule ordinarily applies where a public service corporation attempts to delegate its duty to an independent contractor. (See Rest.2d Torts, ¤ 428,
434
*434 com. a.) The rule has, however, also been held to apply if an employer is subject to regulations enacted for the protection of the public. "An employer is generally liable for negligent acts of an employee performed within the scope of employment, but if an independent contractor rather than master and servant relationship exists, the independent contractor usually is alone liable for his negligent acts. If, however, an individual or corporation undertakes to carry on an activity involving possible danger to the public under a license or franchise granted by public authority subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority, these liabilities may not be evaded by delegating performance to an independent contractor. The original contractor remains subject to liability for harm caused by the negligence of the independent contractor employed to do the work." (Taylor v. Oakland Scavenger Co. (1941) 17 Cal.2d 594, 604 [110 P.2d 1044].)
In Eli v. Murphy (1952) 39 Cal.2d 598 [248 P.2d 756], for example, the activity at issue was the operation of a tractor and semitrailer; an activity which (1) is attended with very considerable risk (id. at p. 599), and (2) is highly regulated in order to protect the public safety. (Id. at pp. 599-600.) The court in that case found that the effectiveness of those regulations would be impaired if the carrier could circumvent them by having the regulated operations conducted by an independent contractor. It followed that "Highway common carriers may not, therefore, insulate themselves from liability for negligence occurring in the conduct of their business by engaging independent contractors to transport freight for them." (Id. at p. 601.)
Millsap introduced evidence that FEC carried a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission and, accordingly, was required by that agency to carry liability insurance. (See 49 U.S.C. ¤ 10927(a)(1).) From this she argues that FEC must be held responsible for any negligence attributable to NCE. FEC, however, is not a party to this appeal.
The pivotal issue is whether NCE's operations were "subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority" such that NCE must be held responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor to whom it delegated those duties. The relevant statutes, and the record, indicate that it should not be held so responsible. Thus, 49 United States Code section 10526, provides: "(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter over  ... [¦] (8)(B) transportation of property (including baggage) by motor vehicle as part of a continuous movement which, prior or subsequent to such part of the continuous movement, has been or will be transported by an air carrier...." Further, the record contains a letter from the Public Utilities Commission to NCE replying to NCE's letter describing its operations and asking if it was
435
*435 required to carry insurance pursuant to Public Utilities Commission licensing requirements: "Based on the description in that letter your company falls within the air freight motor carrier exemption and, therefore, is not required to have authority either from the Public Utilities Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission." That NCE was not regulated makes inapplicable the rule stated in section 428 of the Restatement Second of Torts and in Eli v. Murphy and related cases.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION

Finding that on the facts before the trial court Pence was acting as an independent contractor, and that NCE was not precluded from delegating to Pence the responsibility of delivering packages without incurring any liability resulting therefrom, we affirm the judgment.
Racanelli, P.J., and Newsom, J., concurred.
[1] Millsap stated as one of the legal bases for her motion to vacate, "The Court has failed to indicate which Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment it has ruled upon. The Court appears to be considering the Motion filed by FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION only. But both motions were argued and submitted at the same time and both are inextricably linked to such an extent that resolution of the Motion of ... NORTH COUNTRY EXPRESS is imperative before Plaintiffs can ascertain in whose favor the Court has intended to rule and before Plaintiffs can make a determination as to whether their remedy is an appeal or writ."
[2] Millsap may have been attempting to raise the point that this exception to the one final judgment rule does not apply if the party involved in the purported judgment has such a unity of interests with another party that its interests cannot be finally determined until those of the uninvolved party are finally resolved. In such a case the judgment purported to be final as to one party is deemed no more than an interlocutory order. (See Fleuret v. Hale Constr. Co. (1970) 12 Cal. App.3d 227, 230 [90 Cal. Rptr. 557], involving a surety and a principal.) This rule has no application here, where, although one of two theories of defense asserted by FEC was identical to that asserted by NCE (i.e., that Pence was an independent contractor), the rights of FEC and NCE are not interdependent. Moreover, the court's ruling specified that it was based on an understanding that NCE was an independent contractor of FEC. Thus, the court did not rule on the defenses shared by FEC and NCE.
[3] Although not argued by Millsap in her appellate briefs, it has also been stated that the power of an employer to terminate the employment at any time "`is a strong circumstance tending to show the subserviency of the employee, since it is incompatible with the full control of the work usually enjoyed by an independent contractor. Perhaps no single circumstance is more conclusive to show the relationship of an employee than the right of the employer to end the service whenever he sees fit to do so.'" (Brose v. Union-Tribune Publishing Co., supra, 183 Cal. App.3d at p. 1085.) The significance of this factor in the instant case, however, is minimal as it appears that, although Pence had an ongoing relationship with NCE, each time he picked up packages for delivery operated, in essence, as a new contract. At any time NCE could choose not to continue its relationship with Pence, but that choice would be more of a determination not to hire than a determination to fire.
[4] Contrast the situation in Yellow Cab Cooperative, Inc. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1991) 226 Cal. App.3d 1288 [277 Cal. Rptr. 434]: Yellow Cab controlled drivers by assigning shifts, instructing on where to drive, how to behave, when to pick up passengers, when not to pick up passengers, when to return to yard.</p>

<p>OPINION

MARCHIANO, P. J. 
Plaintiff Kimbly Arnold worked as a nonexclusive insurance agent for Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company (Mutual). After plaintiff terminated her contractual relationship with Mutual, she filed suit claiming unpaid employee entitlements under the Labor Code.[1] She appeals from a summary judgment in favor of defendant Mutual, in which the trial court determined Ms. Arnold's causes of action depended on her being a former "employee" of Mutual, and the undisputed facts established she was not an employee, but rather an independent contractor. Arnold claims the court erred in concluding the common law test for employment was applicable to determine whether she was an "employee," arguing that a broader statutory definition of "employee" is applicable under section 2750. Alternatively, she contends the court incorrectly applied the common law test when it determined there were no triable issues of material fact and concluded she was not an "employee" as a matter of law. As discussed below, we conclude after a de novo review the trial court was correct, and we affirm the summary judgment.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND

On January 25, 2010, Arnold filed a complaint against Mutual on her behalf and on behalf of a class of other persons similarly situated, whom Mutual allegedly employed as a "Licensed Agent" or "Sales Representative." The complaint consisted of three causes of action. The first cause of action
583
*583 alleged Mutual failed to reimburse Arnold and class members fully for "necessary business-related expenses and costs" to which they were entitled under sections 2800 and 2802.[2] The second cause of action alleged Mutual had willfully failed to pay Arnold and class members for wages earned but unpaid prior to their being discharged from employment or prior to their quitting employment, for which they were entitled to recover under sections 201, 202 and 203.[3] A third cause of action alleged Mutual's conduct violating Labor Code sections 2800 and 2802 additionally constituted an unlawful business practice in violation of the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. & Prof. Code, ¤ 17200 et seq.), for which Arnold and class members sought compensation, an injunction requiring Mutual to pay all outstanding wages, costs, and attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
(1) Mutual filed a motion for summary judgment on September 28, 2010, contending Arnold's first two causes of actions "hinge[d] entirely on her alleged status as an `employee' of Mutual." For example, reimbursement under section 2802 is due only to an "employee" who incurs necessary expenditures or losses, whereas a claim for earned but unpaid wages under section 202 arises only when an "employee" quits his or her employment. Mutual argued these provisions of the Labor Code were not subject to a statutory definition of "employee,"[4] and consequently were subject to the common law test of employment. According to Mutual, undisputed material facts established Arnold was an independent contractor rather than a former employee under the common law test, and hence, she was not entitled to any relief under her first or second causes of action. Because Arnold's third cause of action under the UCL was derivative of her first cause of action, it similarly afforded her no relief as a matter of law.
(2) In making this argument, Mutual relied in part on the Supreme Court decision in S. G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations
584
*584 (1989) 48 Cal.3d 341 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399] (Borello), which restated the "`principal test of an employment relationship'" under common law to be "`whether the person to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired....'" (Id. at p. 350.) Borello recognized that this "principal" factor of the common law test, focusing on the issue of control, was not exclusive, and articulated "[a]dditional factors." (Id. at p. 351.) These were whether the principal has the right to discharge at will, without cause; whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision; the skill required in the particular occupation; whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work; the length of time for which the services are to be performed; the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and, whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee. (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 350-351.) The court in Borello observed that such "`individual factors'" were not to be "`applied mechanically as separate tests,'" but were "intertwined," and often given weight depending on the particular combination of factors. (Id. at p. 351.)
Supporting evidence showed Arnold was licensed by the Department of Insurance as an independent agent or broker, authorized to offer products to prospective clients from different companies. When she first contracted with Mutual, in November 2006, she was under appointment with another insurance company to offer its products, and while under that appointment had acted on behalf of a third insurance company. At both of these insurance companies she performed as an independent contractor, receiving commissions and 1099 tax forms for that income.
Under Arnold's contract with Mutual, the latter appointed her as a nonexclusive "agent" to solicit and procure applications for Mutual's products. Arnold had the responsibility to maintain the proper licenses required to perform this service. Her chief duties were to procure and submit applications for Mutual's products, collect moneys, and service clients. Compensation was by commission for products sold, with a chargeback on any commission paid when moneys for sale of a product were uncollected or refunded. Either party could terminate the contract with or without cause through written notice to the other, with automatic termination in the event Arnold failed to submit an application for one of Mutual's products for a period of 180 days.
One clause of the contract stated that Arnold was "an independent contractor and not an employee," that no terms of the contract "shall be construed as
585
*585 creating an employer-employee relationship," and that Arnold was "free to exercise [her] own judgment as to the persons from whom [she] will solicit and the time, place and manner, and amount of such solicitation." During her deposition, Arnold said she had read the contract, and understood when she signed it that her appointment with Mutual was as an independent contractor. She agreed she used her own judgment in tending to her business and more particularly in determining whom she would solicit for applications for Mutual's products, when and where she would do so, and the amount of time she spent engaging in such solicitations.
Arnold exercised her contractual right to terminate her appointment with Mutual by a letter dated March 24, 2008, which advised Mutual that she had entered into a contract to represent another insurance company exclusively, and was prohibited from maintaining her appointment with Mutual.
The assistant general manager of Mutual's sales office in Concord averred he supervised the process of agent appointments to that office, and as such was familiar with Arnold's appointment in 2006. During her appointment with Mutual, Arnold did not receive performance evaluations, and he did not monitor or supervise her work schedule. While he conducted meetings and offered training sessions to appointed agents such as Arnold, their attendance was not required. Agents assigned to the Concord office were required to pay for their own business expenses; Mutual did not provide business cards, vehicles, or computers free of charge. Agents could, but were not required to work "out of the Concord office," but if they chose to do so, they were required to pay monthly fees to cover "workspace and telephone service." Items purchased by Arnold from Mutual appeared on a monthly "Agent Expense Statement." At the time Arnold terminated her appointment in March 2008, she owed Mutual approximately $2,288 for such expenses. These expenses remained unpaid as of September 2010.
After a hearing, the trial court granted Mutual's motion for summary judgment, observing it was "very confident" Arnold was "not an employee." Its written order ruled that all three of Arnold's causes of action were dependant on her status as an "employee" of Mutual rather than as an independent contractor. In determining her status, the court found "the common law test" applicable to determine whether she was an "employee," in the absence of an applicable statutory definition. Applying the common law test, the court concluded undisputed facts established that Arnold was an independent contractor and not an employee within the meaning of sections 202 and 2802.
Notice of entry of judgment was entered the same day. Arnold's appeal followed. (See Code Civ. Proc., ¤ 437c, subd. (m)(1).)</p>

*586 DISCUSSION


A. Standard of Review

We review a grant of summary judgment independently. (Knight v. Hayward Unified School Dist. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 121, 128 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 287]; see Kolodge v. Boyd (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 349, 355-356 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 749].) Summary judgment is proper "if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law...." (Code Civ. Proc., ¤ 437c, subd. (c); see Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] (Aguilar).) A defendant seeking summary judgment must thus establish that one or more essential elements of the plaintiff's cause of action cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., ¤ 437c, subd. (p)(2); Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; see also Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143] (Saelzler).)</p>

<p>B. Applicability of the Common Law Test for Employment

Arnold contends it was error to apply the common law test expressed in Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, to determine whether she was an "employee" within the meaning of section 2802  the alleged violation of which formed the basis of both her first cause of action, as well as the derivative third cause of action under the UCL. She reasons section 2750 provides a statutory definition that governs the meaning of "employee" as it is used in section 2802, and undisputed facts established her as an "employee" within the broader definition supplied by section 2750.
(3) A statute will be construed in light of the common law unless the Legislature clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise. (Reynolds v. Bement (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075, 1086-1087 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 483, 116 P.3d 1162], disapproved on another ground in Martinez v. Combs (2010) 49 Cal.4th 35, 62-66 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 514, 231 P.3d 259].) Thus, when a statute refers to an "employee" without defining the term, courts have generally applied the common law test of employment to that statute. (See Metropolitan Water Dist. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 491, 500 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 857, 84 P.3d 966].)
One reviewing court has recently held the Labor Code does not expressly define "employee" for purposes of section 2802, and therefore, the common law test of employment applies to that section. (Estrada v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1, 10 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 327] (Estrada).) That court went on to cite the "principal" and "additional factors"
587
*587 of the common law test as articulated by the Supreme Court in Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, and summarized above. (Estrada, supra, at p. 10.)
It is unclear whether the reviewing court in Estrada, supra, 154 Cal.App.4th 1, was called upon to consider whether section 2750 provided the statutory definition of "employee" when it concluded such a definition did not exist. In any event, section 2750 does not supply such a definition of "employee" that is clearly and unequivocally intended to supplant the common law definition of employment for purposes of section 2802. It is true section 2750  like section 2802  is a part of division 3 of the Labor Code (Employment Relations). However, section 2750 provides only that "[t]he contract of employment is a contract by which one, who is called the employer, engages another, who is called the employee, to do something for the benefit of the employer or a third person." (¤ 2750.) As such, it does not attempt to define "employee" so much as it uses the term "employee" in defining "contract of employment." At least one court has considered section 2750 and concluded it was to be viewed with, and not instead of, the common law test for employment. (See Randolph v. Budget Rent-A-Car (9th Cir. 1996) 97 F.3d 319, 325.)
Further, we note two statutes that immediately follow section 2750, which together with section 2750 form a part of article 1 of chapter 2 in division 3 of the Labor Code. These sections provide rebuttable presumptions, respectively, that a licensed contractor is an employee rather than an independent contractor, and a physician working for a primary care clinic is an independent contractor rather than an employee. (¤¤ 2750.5, 2750.6.) These presumptions clearly qualify, in particular cases, the common law distinction between "employee" and "independent contractor." As such, they would conflict with section 2750 were it to be construed to supplant the application of that distinction.
We are not persuaded otherwise by Arnold's arguments concerning the legislative history of division 3 of the Labor Code. Whatever the scope of former division 3 when it was first enacted as part of the Civil Code, that division since 1937 has been limited in its application to situations not otherwise covered by the Workers' Compensation Act set out in divisions 4 and 4.5 of the Labor Code. (See Lab. Code, ¤ 2700; see also Code Commission Notes, 44C West's Ann. Lab. Code (2011 ed.) foll. ¤ 2700, p. 135.) Nor are we persuaded by her reliance on Foxx v. Williams (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 223 [52 Cal.Rptr. 896] (Foxx). The Court of Appeal in Foxx considered section 2750 only in the context of a contract for personal services under section 2855, and in light of the since repealed provisions of chapter 3 of division 3 (former ¤ 3000 et seq., enacted by Stats. 1937, ch. 90, pp. 261-262 and repealed by Stats. 1969, ch. 1537, ¤ 1, p. 3132), relating to
588
*588 "Master and Servant." In this context, the court simply observed that "employee," as used in section 2750 appeared inferentially to have a broader meaning than "servant" in former section 3000. (Foxx, supra, 244 Cal.App.2d at p. 240.) Nowhere does the holding in Foxx contradict the recent holding in Estrada, supra, 154 Cal.App.4th 1, that the common law test for employment applies to define "employee" in section 2802.
We conclude the trial court correctly determined the common law test of employment was applicable for purposes of section 2802, in conformity with Estrada, supra, 154 Cal.App.4th at page 10.</p>

<p>C. Application of the Common Law Test to the Evidence

Arnold claims  to the extent the common law test for employment was applicable to her causes of action  that the trial court nevertheless applied it incorrectly, largely because it based its decision on facts relating to the degree of control Mutual actually asserted over her work instead of the degree of control Mutual was entitled to assert. She urges, in effect, her opposing evidence raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether she was an "employee" rather than an "independent contractor."
In conducting our independent review, we view Arnold's opposing evidence liberally, and Mutual's supporting evidence strictly, to determine whether a triable issue of material facts exists. (See Saelzler, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 768.)
In support of her argument, Arnold cites to her opposing statement listing triable issues of material fact. We examine the opposing evidence rather than the opposing party's characterization of that evidence in his or her opposing statement of undisputed and disputed material facts. (See Code Civ. Proc., ¤ 437c, subd. (c).) The evidence has telling characteristics. It shows, for example, that Mutual managers make themselves available to assist agents, as distinguished from supervising them. Training is generally not mandatory and is offered chiefly for the guidance of "new" agents. Training is required only with respect to compliance with state law directives. Managers provide assistance with sales or clients when an agent "wants them to assist." Software is provided by Mutual as a "best practice" to enable agents to sell its products more successfully. Conference rooms, if available, are provided as a courtesy to agents seeking to set up a meeting and having no other space in the office. Mutual policy does not otherwise reimburse agents for regular business expenses, such as entertaining a client, although it does provide certain "prospecting" credits, beginning when an agent is newly appointed, by which the agent might apply for reimbursement for mailings, newsletters, and similar expenses to generate new business for Mutual products. The credits
589
*589 must be used and have no separate compensatory value. While Mutual pays its agents in two-week periods, payments are comprised of commissions and bonuses established by policy, and there is no guaranteed compensation; advances may be authorized only by a general manager in the event an agent has submitted an application for which a policy is likely to be issued. Advances are rare, due to the policy to pay commissions only on business actually issued, as opposed to routine advances for the purpose of regularizing payment amounts.
(4) After a careful review of the opposing evidence, we find nothing that raises a material conflict with the supporting evidence summarized above. The salient evidentiary points established Arnold used her own judgment in determining whom she would solicit for applications for Mutual's products, the time, place, and manner in which she would solicit, and the amount of time she spent soliciting for Mutual's products. Her appointment with Mutual was nonexclusive, and she in fact solicited for other insurance companies during her appointment with Mutual. Her assistant general manager at Mutual's Concord office did not evaluate her performance and did not monitor or supervise her work. Training offered by Mutual was voluntary for agents, except as required for compliance with state law. Agents who chose to use the Concord office were required to pay a fee for their workspace and telephone service. Arnold's minimal performance requirement to avoid automatic termination of her appointment was to submit one application for Mutual's products within each 180-day period. Thus, under the principal test for employment under common law principles, Mutual had no significant right to control the manner and means by which Arnold accomplished the results of the services she performed as one of Mutual's soliciting agents. (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 350.)
The additional factors of the common law test also weigh in favor of finding an independent contractor relationship. Although Mutual could terminate the appointment at will, a termination at-will clause for both parties may properly be included in an independent contractor agreement, and is not by itself a basis for changing that relationship to one of an employee. (Varisco v. Gateway Science & Engineering, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1107 [83 Cal.Rptr.3d 393] (Varisco).) Notably, Arnold was engaged in a distinct occupation requiring a license from the Department of Insurance, and was responsible for her own instrumentalities or tools with the exception of limited resources offered by Mutual to enhance their agents' successful solicitation of Mutual's products. Arnold was required to pay a fee for the use of Mutual's office space and telephone service. Although Mutual paid its agents in a systematic way every two weeks, Arnold's payment itself  chiefly commissions  was based on her results and not the amount of time she spent working on Mutual's behalf. Finally, both Arnold and Mutual
590
*590 believed, at the time of her appointment, they were creating an independent contractor relationship and not an employee relationship. (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 350-351.)
The existence and degree of each factor of the common law test for employment is a question of fact, while the legal conclusion to be drawn from those facts is a question of law. (Harris v. Vector Marketing Corp. (N.D.Cal. 2009) 656 F.Supp.2d 1128, 1136.) Even if one or two of the individual factors might suggest an employment relationship, summary judgment is nevertheless proper when, as here, all the factors weighed and considered as a whole establish that Arnold was an independent contractor and not an employee for purposes of sections 202 and 2802. (See Varisco, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1106.) In light of the evidence, we have little difficulty concluding the trial court reached the correct conclusion when it applied the common law test for employment articulated in Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, to the evidence presented in this case.
We note Arnold objects to certain decisions cited by the trial court in its order granting the motion for summary judgment. Having found it unnecessary to rely on those decisions in conducting our de novo review, we deem it unnecessary to address the merits of this objection.</p>

<p>DISPOSITION

The judgment is affirmed.
Margulies, J., and Dondero, J., concurred.
[1] All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.
[2] Section 2802 requires an employer to "indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful." (¤ 2802, subd. (a).) Section 2800, on which Arnold's first cause of action also relied, requires an employer to indemnify an employee for losses arising from the employer's want of ordinary care.
[3] Section 201 requires an employer who discharges an employee to pay immediately any earned but unpaid wages, whereas section 202 requires a similar payment within 72 hours of notice when an employee quits (and does not have a written contract for a definite period of employment). (¤¤ 201, subd. (a), 202, subd. (a).) Section 203 provides for penalties when an employer willfully fails to make payments in violation of sections 201 and 202. (¤ 203, subd. (a).)
[4] In particular, the statutory definition of "employee" set out in section 3351 applies only to the Workers' Compensation Act (¤ 3200 et seq.) and not to those divisions of the Labor Code that include sections 202 and 2802. (See ¤ 3350.)</p>

RAYE, J.
Different tax results flow from whether a worker is classified as an employee or an independent contractor. Plaintiffs Air Couriers International (formerly known as Sonic Couriers of Arizona, Inc.), UPS Service Parts Logistics, Inc. (formerly known as Sonic Air, Inc., and Arizona Sonic Air, Inc.) and UPS Logistics Group (collectively referred to as Sonic) employ drivers to pick up and deliver packages in a timely manner. Sonic filed a complaint for refund against defendant Director of the Employment Development Department (Department) to recover employment taxes it paid for the drivers. Sonic argued the drivers operated as independent contractors, a claim rejected by the trial court following a court trial. Sonic appeals, contending the trial court employed the wrong standard, no substantial evidence supports the court's finding of employment status, and the court abused its discretion in holding Sonic liable for penalties. We shall affirm the judgment.</p>

<p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

In May 2003 Sonic filed suit as authorized by Unemployment Insurance Code section 1241 to recover "Contributions, Personal Income Tax, Penalties and Interest." The Department filed an answer and the case proceeded to a court trial.</p>

<p>Sonic's Case

At trial, Sonic presented testimony by dispatchers, drivers, supervisors, and a retired operations vice president regarding the circumstances of the drivers' employment. Drivers delivered packages between businesses and to the airport. Drivers serviced numerous customers; fewer than one percent performed services for only one customer.
Drivers worked flexible schedules. Individual drivers determined their own schedules and decided when and how long to work. Some drivers, by choice, worked long hours. Drivers took breaks, and they alone determined the frequency and duration of the breaks.
Many drivers worked other jobs while driving for Sonic. These other jobs could conflict with their Sonic work. Sonic made no effort to prevent drivers from working other jobs, including delivering for other companies.
Sonic did not require drivers to accept each and every job. To the contrary, drivers rejected jobs for a variety of reasons and were not required to provide reasons for doing so. Drivers who rejected jobs did not suffer adverse consequences; they continued to receive assignments.
Drivers were paid by the job, with mileage factored into the job rate. Sonic paid drivers biweekly based on handwritten and computer manifests. Sonic did not provide
39
*39 the drivers sick leave, paid vacation, or medical insurance.
Many jobs were paid under a flat rate, based on the number of miles driven. Drivers negotiated higher rates on some jobs for a variety of reasons, including "after hours" charges, premiums for long drives, amounts added for "deadhead miles," and weekend charges. There were no negative repercussions for negotiating rates.
Drivers with superior skills made more money. These drivers possessed better communication and customer relations skills, worked better under the pressure of time sensitive deliveries, and were savvy about pricing their jobs.
Sonic did not provide drivers with formal training. Instead, new drivers often learned the ropes from family members who also worked for Sonic.
Drivers supplied their own vehicles, supplies, and equipment when delivering for Sonic. Drivers typically drove their own pickup trucks and used their own cellular phones, and some provided their own business cards.
Sonic did not require drivers to wear uniforms, and most did not, although some drivers wore uniforms to expedite access to buildings and airports. Nor did Sonic require drivers to wear identification badges, although some drivers used identification badges to gain access to airports and high security buildings.
Sonic issued Internal Revenue Service 1099 forms to drivers that reflected the amount of compensation earned for the year. Drivers reported the income earned from driving on their individual tax returns and deducted expenses incurred.
Sonic began utilizing independent contract drivers in response to intense competition, which made use of salaried drivers unfeasible. Independent drivers allowed Sonic to avoid the cost of maintaining a fleet of delivery vehicles, and to save on administrative costs. Sonic did not employ independent contractors to save on taxes.
Dispatchers, who were Sonic salaried employees, called drivers and gave out work assignments. Dispatchers did not provide driving directions. Instead, drivers determined their own routes and order of delivery.
Almost all drivers executed independent contractor agreements (Contract) beginning in 1994. When a new driver signed up, Sonic's operations manager reviewed the Contract with the driver, paragraph by paragraph, and answered the driver's questions about the document. The operations manager made sure the drivers understood "what independent contractor meant to them." The drivers understood they operated as independent contractors.</p>

<p>The Department's Case

This appeal requires us to determine whether sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that Sonic's drivers did not operate as independent contractors. The Department does not undertake an analysis of the evidence produced at trial. The Department's brief merely quotes the trial court's final statement of decision.
A party on appeal has the duty to support the arguments in the briefs by appropriate reference to the record, which includes providing exact page citations. We have no duty to search the record for evidence and may disregard any factual contention not supported by proper citations to the record. (Redevelopment Agency v. Rados Bros. (2001) 95 Cal. App.4th 309, 317, fn. 6, 115 Cal.Rptr.2d 234.)
It is incumbent upon the respondent, in responding to a claim of insufficient
40
*40 evidence, to provide this court with an accurate summary of the evidence, complete with page citations, that the respondent believes supports the trial court's judgment. The Department has failed to comply with this requirement. Simply citing the trial court's judgment is neither helpful nor sufficient. Nonetheless, we conclude the judgment is supported by ample evidence.
The Department presented testimony from several drivers and an auditor from the California Franchise Tax Board, who presented a far different picture of the relationship between Sonic and the delivery drivers.
Harry Contos, a Sonic driver since 1984 and ultimately a branch manager, testified many drivers never signed a Contract with Sonic during the period from 1992 to mid-1994. In most cases drivers did not turn down jobs relayed to them by the dispatchers. Dispatchers gave drivers the pick-up and delivery times, and drivers were terminated if they proved unreliable.
New drivers began by driving with more experienced Sonic drivers. Sonic also provided a training video. Uniforms were available for drivers. Uniforms were useful for identification as a Sonic driver and also prevented drivers from working for other employers while uniformed. Many drivers worked as Sonic drivers for lengthy tenures.
Ronald Kelly had worked for Sonic since 1995. Kelly signed a contract, but no one explained the meaning of independent contractor to him. After going to work for Sonic, Kelly did not add Sonic to his automobile insurance or obtain workers' compensation insurance. Kelly did not obtain a business license or solicit other delivery customers.
As a new driver, Kelly drove around with a more experienced Sonic driver. Sonic provided a pager that Kelly used to respond to the dispatcher.
Kelly worked 11 hours a day, Monday through Friday. He also worked long hours on the weekends. Every job involved a deadline, and Kelly rarely turned down jobs. Monday through Friday Kelly regularly provided delivery services for the same customers. Sonic paid him biweekly.
Kelly wore a Sonic identification badge and purchased a uniform. He attended about four meetings in which Sonic discussed driver complaints. Sonic also provided special logo tape for packages and manifest sheets on which to record his deliveries.
On cross-examination, Kelly acknowledged he could have chosen to work shorter hours. He also could take vacations whenever he wished without having to inform Sonic of his absence. Sonic did not require Kelly to attend meetings. Kelly did not receive sick pay, bonuses, vacation pay, or health insurance from Sonic.
Timothy Glasser drove for Sonic from 1989 through April 1994. Glasser could not recall ever signing a Contract with Sonic. He believed he never received any paperwork explaining his relationship with Sonic or his responsibilities. On his first day of work Glasser was told he was an independent contractor. He asked if he needed special insurance but was told he did not. Sonic paid Glasser by the hour for hours worked Monday through Friday.
Glasser rarely turned down jobs. He possessed no business license, took out no advertising, and had no other employer. Glasser never employed anyone to assist him with his deliveries. Sonic provided logo packages, tape, and a placard for his windshield. Glasser used his personal vehicle for delivering packages.
41
*41 On cross-examination, Glasser testified he paid his own expenses when making deliveries. Sonic did not supervise or discipline him, and he received no vacation or sick pay.
Christopher Kee drove for Sonic from 1985 through fall of 1996. His ex-wife was also employed at Sonic and worked as a dispatcher and driver. Kee could not recall ever signing a Contract.
Kee worked a regular route, picking up from the same customers each day. Sonic provided him a pager, and Kee had a mailbox at Sonic. Kee wore a Sonic uniform shirt at Sonic's request. The uniform enabled drivers to maintain a professional appearance, particularly around upper management. Most drivers wore the uniform shirts.
Kee was paid by the job and rarely turned down jobs. Kee believed turning down a job created the risk of not getting any more work. His ex-wife, who worked as a dispatcher and driver, told him this was company policy. Kee successfully negotiated a higher rate for one job; he was unsuccessful in another attempt at negotiation.
Kee did not deliver for any other company while working at Sonic. He did not have a business license, purchase insurance, or buy a special vehicle. Kee did not solicit customers. He believed the dispatcher supervised him.
Kee, during cross-examination, testified Sonic never disciplined him. Nor did Sonic pay sick leave, vacation leave, or bonuses.
Cherrie Hayes, a former tax auditor for the Department, performed an audit at Sonic covering the years 1992 through 1994. The audit's purpose was to determine whether 17 Sonic drivers were properly classified as independent contractors. Hayes used Department criteria to make her determination. Hayes found only one driver qualified as an independent contractor; this driver had made a substantial financial investment in a large long-haul truck.
Hayes interviewed the other 16 drivers and asked for documentation such as business licenses, insurance, or contracts that would support a finding of independent contractor status. She found no evidence the drivers worked for employers other than Sonic; none of the drivers had invested in vehicles specifically earmarked for deliveries or had business licenses. In addition, neither the drivers nor Sonic were able to produce any contracts. Although Sonic's management promised to provide Hayes with documentation supporting its assertion of independent contractor status, no documentation was ever forthcoming.
Hayes ultimately concluded the 16 drivers were not independent contractors. On cross-examination, Hayes acknowledged drivers could determine their own routes, could reject assignments, and received no formal training from Sonic. However, Hayes also testified drivers who rejected jobs risked not getting future jobs. Hayes was not aware of any drivers negotiating rates.</p>

<p>The Trial Court's Decision

The trial court found, as a matter of law, that Sonic's drivers were not independent contractors. Although Sonic claimed all its drivers executed the Contract that established the independent contractor relationship, the court found no evidence was presented that four drivers who testified executed any Contract, and one driver testified he operated without a Contract. In addition, Sonic produced three conflicting versions of the Contract at trial, and testimony revealed Sonic failed to enforce the Contract. Sonic also failed to ensure the
42
*42 drivers understood the legal and practical ramifications of the Contract. For these reasons, the court found the Sonic Contracts insufficient to have created an independent contractor relationship between the company and its drivers.
The court determined the drivers performed an integral and entirely essential aspect of Sonic's business. Sonic provided forms the drivers were required to utilize in order to be paid, provided pick-up and delivery deadlines for each delivery, encouraged drivers to wear uniforms, and provided identification badges and vehicle placards. The customers serviced by the drivers were Sonic customers, not customers of the drivers. Therefore, Sonic retained all necessary control over the drivers, negating its claim that the drivers operated as independent contractors.
The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Department. Sonic filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION


I

California has established an unemployment insurance program providing benefits for "persons unemployed through no fault of their own, and to reduce involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to a minimum." (Unemp.Ins.Code, ¤ 100.)[1] Contributions from employers to the Department completely fund the program. (¤ 976.)
In addition, the Department administers a disability insurance program that mitigates the burdens that fall on the unemployed and disabled worker and his or her family. (¤ 2601.) Contributions from workers withheld by employers and remitted to the Department fund this program. (¤¤ 984, 986.)
The Department also administers a program designed to "promptly place job-ready individuals in suitable jobs, to provide qualified job applicants to employers, to assist potentially employable individuals to become job ready, and to create employment opportunities." (¤ 9000.) The program is funded by contributions from employers based on wages paid to employees. (¤ 976.6.)
Sections 13020 and 13021 require employers to withhold and remit to the Department their employees' state income tax payments. Section 621, subdivision (b) defines an employee as "Any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee." An independent contractor does not come within the scope of these provisions. (Empire Star Mines Co. v. Cal. Emp. Com. (1946) 28 Cal.2d 33, 43, 168 P.2d 686 (Empire Star).)
Sonic filed suit against the Department for a refund of contributions, interest, and penalties pursuant to section 1241 following the issuance of assessments to Sonic and Sonic's payment to the Department. Sonic argues these payments, totaling $617,328.33 plus interest, were incorrectly levied against independent contractor drivers rather than employees.</p>

<p>II

Sonic begins by challenging the trial court's reliance on S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399 (Borello) in determining the drivers' status. Sonic argues Borello applies only to workers' compensation cases and the present case involves employment taxes incorrectly assessed under the California
43
*43 Unemployment Insurance Code. Sonic contends the trial court should have applied the legal standard for worker classification set forth in Empire Star.
As Sonic correctly notes, the determination of the correct legal standard to be applied by the trial court presents a question of law, which we review de novo. (Topanga and Victory Partners v. Toghia (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 775, 779-780, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 104.) We begin our consideration of the appropriate standard of review with the oldest case on employment status, Empire Star, in which the Supreme Court considered whether individuals who leased portions of Empire Star's mine were employees or independent contractors. Empire Star claimed the lease holders were independent contractors and requested reimbursement of unemployment insurance taxes. (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at pp. 36-37, 168 P.2d 686.)
To determine the status of the lease holders, the Supreme Court noted the "most important factor is the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired. If the employer has the authority to exercise complete control, whether or not that right is exercised with respect to all details, an employer-employee relationship exists. Strong evidence in support of an employment relationship is the right to discharge at will, without cause." (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at p. 43, 168 P.2d 686.)
It is this language that Sonic seizes upon, focusing laser-like on the issue of control. However, the Empire Star court did not set forth control as the sole consideration in evaluating the employment relationship.
Instead, the court noted: "Other factors to be taken into consideration are (a) whether or not the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the principal or the workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be performed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee." (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at pp. 43-44, 168 P.2d 686; Rest., Agency, ¤ 220.)
Applying the primary factor of control and the secondary enumerated factors, the Empire Star court found the lease holders determined for themselves what work they would do and how it should be done. They fixed their own working time, and no lease holder was requested to discharge anyone. All of this evidence tended to prove the lease holders were carrying on mining activities at their own risk and for their own profit. The Supreme Court found the lease holders were not employees and ordered the taxes reimbursed. (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at pp. 44-45, 49, 168 P.2d 686.)
The Supreme Court considered another unemployment insurance reimbursement case in Tieberg v. Unemployment Ins.App. Bd. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 943, 88 Cal. Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975 (Tieberg). In Tieberg, the court considered whether individuals hired as writers of teleplays were employees or independent contractors of a television producer. Citing Empire Star, the Tieberg court reiterated the primacy of control and also noted the secondary factors to be considered in evaluating employment
44
*44 status. (Tieberg, supra, 2 Cal.3d at pp. 949-950, 88 Cal.Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975.) The court found the producer exercised control and direction over the writers in supervising rewrites. In addition, the court found several of the secondary factors pointed toward the writers of teleplays as employees of the producer. (Id. at pp. 952-953, 88 Cal.Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975.)
This court, in Grant v. Woods (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 647, 139 Cal.Rptr. 533 (Grant), considered whether newspaper carriers were employees in an action for refund of contributions paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund. We cited Empire Star for the proposition that the primary factor to be considered is whether the right to control lies within the relationship. We observed: "If an employment relationship exists, the fact that a certain amount of freedom is allowed or is inherent in the nature of the work involved does not change the character of the relationship, particularly where the employer has general supervision and control." (Grant, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at p. 653, 139 Cal.Rptr. 533.) We also echoed Empire Star and Tieberg in noting the list of secondary factors to be considered in evaluating the employment relationship. (Grant, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at pp. 652-653 & fn. 2, 139 Cal.Rptr. 533.)
In concluding newspaper carriers were employees and not independent contractors, we found newspaper delivery is not a highly skilled operation requiring close scrutiny and control by the employer. A certain amount of employee freedom is inherent in the work. The employer possessed the right to control the carriers: he required papers be delivered to specific subscribers at a specified time, handled complaints, advised carriers on methods of operation, and retained the right to terminate carriers. In addition, the carriers were not involved in a separate and distinct occupation of their own; they were essential to the employer's business. Many carriers were employed for lengthy periods of time. (Grant, supra, 71 Cal. App.3d at p. 653, 139 Cal.Rptr. 533.)
Borello, the source of much controversy in the present case, followed in 1989. In Borello, as Sonic repeatedly points out, the court determined whether agricultural laborers engaged to harvest cucumbers under a written "sharefarmer" agreement were independent contractors exempt from workers' compensation coverage. Sonic stresses that Borello did not consider a refund for contributions pursuant to the Unemployment Insurance Act, but rather the applicability of workers' compensation laws.
However, in many aspects Borello echoes Empire Star. The Supreme Court noted that the distinction between independent contractors and employees in the common law context arose to limit one's vicarious liability for the misconduct of a person rendering service to the purported employer. The principal's supervisory power was crucial because the extent to which the employer had the right to control the details of the service rendered was highly relevant to whether the employer ought to be liable. Thus, the control test became the principal measure of a "servant's status for common law purposes." (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 350, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
However, Borello also observed: "[C]ourts have long recognized that the `control' test, applied rigidly and in isolation, is often of little use in evaluating the infinite variety of service arrangements. While conceding that the right to control work details is the `most important' or `most significant' consideration, the authorities also endorse several `secondary' indicia of the nature of a service relationship."
45
*45 (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 350, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.) The Supreme Court then enumerated the secondary factors, citing both Tieberg and Empire Star.[2] (Borello, at p. 351, 256 Cal. Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
The aspect of Borello that Sonic claims makes it inapplicable to the present case is the court's examination of the policy concerns behind the development of workers' compensation law. The court pointed out the distinction between tort policy and social legislation that justifies departures from common law principles when determining whether a worker is covered as an employee. Given this difference, the court concluded that under workers' compensation law, the control test must be applied with deference to the purposes of the protective legislation: "The nature of the work, and the overall arrangement between the parties, must be examined to determine whether they come within the `history and fundamental purposes' of the statute." (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 353-354, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
Sonic claims this deference allowed the Borello court to set a "far more liberal legal standard than existing under common law principles" when determining whether workers are employees or independent contractors. Not so. Borello set forth exactly the same secondary factors to be considered in addition to the issue of control that were enumerated in both Empire Star and Tieberg. The court explicitly declined to adopt "detailed new standards for examination of the issue," but stated that these factors "may often overlap those pertinent under the common law" and that "[e]ach service arrangement must be evaluated on its facts, and the dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case." (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 354, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
Sonic claims Empire Star stands for the proposition that the deferential public policy standard described in Borello only applies in a case concerning benefits and does not apply to a taxation analysis. In support, Sonic notes the Empire Star court's observation that "[t]he objects and purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act are not limited to the raising of revenue. It is a remedial statute and the provisions as to benefits must be liberally construed for the purpose of accomplishing its objects. [Citation.] But there is no basis for the attorney general's contention that because the legislation confers benefits and also imposes taxes, the two parts of the law are inextricably connected. The taxing sections of the legislation are entirely separate from those concerning benefits, and although the benefits are paid from the amount collected as taxes imposed by the act, the provisions fixing liability for payments to the fund are to be considered accordingly." (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at p. 43, 168 P.2d 686.)
Sonic reads this passage as rejecting any deference based on public policy toward
46
*46 finding coverage in cases determining a worker's status in an employment taxation case. We disagree.
The court in Empire Star delineated the significant substantive and procedural differences between the Unemployment Insurance Act's benefit and taxation components in response to the appellant commission's res judicata claims. The commission argued its prior administrative determination that the workers in question were entitled to benefits was res judicata in a later action brought by the employer to recover taxes paid. In the later action, the employer argued the workers were not employees under the Unemployment Insurance Act. The Empire Star court disagreed and determined the administrative benefits determination arose from the different procedural structure and was not res judicata in the latter taxation action. (Empire Star, supra, 28 Cal.2d at pp. 39-40, 46-48, 168 P.2d 686.) Empire Star did not hold that employment determinations in tax cases are to be treated differently than determinations in benefit cases.
Sonic argues: "The trial court erroneously relied upon the case of Borello, supra, and its progeny, for the proposition that the traditional common law test for employee status should not be applied to determine whether the Drivers were independent contractors or employees for employment tax purposes." According to Sonic, Borello sets forth a control standard that is "vastly different" from that articulated in Empire Star. Neither statement is correct. Our review of cases construing the factors to be considered when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor supports the trial court's reliance on the Supreme Court's analysis in Borello. The trial court employed the proper legal standard in evaluating the evidence produced at trial.</p>

<p>
III

Sonic also argues the trial court's finding of employment status of its drivers is not supported by substantial evidence. The substantial evidence standard of review is well settled. In reviewing the evidence on appeal, we resolve all conflicts in favor of the prevailing party, and we indulge in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the finding if possible. Our power begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, that will support the finding. When two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts, we cannot substitute our own deductions for those of the trial court. (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 571, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268.)
In finding the drivers to be employees, the trial court, as instructed by Empire Star, Tieberg, and Borello, considered the extent to which Sonic controlled the work done by the drivers. The court rejected Sonic's claim that its failure to control the actual routes and speeds drivers chose when making deliveries denoted a lack of control. The court noted that the simplicity of the work (take this package from point A to point B) made detailed supervision, or control, unnecessary. Instead, Sonic retained all necessary control over the overall delivery operation. (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 356-357, 256 Cal. Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
The court also rejected Sonic's claim that the drivers themselves controlled the hours they worked. As the court noted and the record reflects, the drivers testified they worked a regular schedule. Many of these schedules involved regular
47
*47 daily routes. Such regular schedules are consistent with employee status and reflect employer control. In addition, the court also found no inconsistency between employee status and the driver's discretion on when to take breaks or vacation.
Finally, the trial court discounted Sonic's claim that drivers actually turned down jobs, again denoting a lack of control by Sonic. At trial, a Sonic manager testified that drivers, as a practical matter, did not turn down jobs. Each driver testified he infrequently turned down jobs.
The trial court also considered the secondary factors enumerated in Empire Star, Tieberg, and Borello. As the court noted, the drivers were not engaged in a separate profession or operating an independent business.
The court found all Sonic required of a driver was a vehicle and automobile insurance; drivers did not make any major investments in equipment or materials. The evidence at trial revealed no driver purchased or leased any special vehicle to make Sonic deliveries.
As the court observed, many of the drivers delivered for Sonic for years. At trial, the drivers testified to lengthy tenures with Sonic, another factor inconsistent with independent contractor status.
The court noted the evidence was uncontroverted that Sonic's drivers were performing an integral and entirely essential aspect of Sonic's business. At trial, drivers testified they were required to use Sonic's forms in order to be paid. The drivers were paid on a regular schedule. Sonic's dispatchers sent the drivers to each delivery and provided deadlines. Drivers notified the dispatchers when the delivery was completed.
Several drivers testified Sonic encouraged them to wear Sonic uniforms. Sonic provided identification badges and placards for the driver's vehicles. Drivers delivered packages to Sonic's customers, not to their own customers. Sonic set the rates charged to customers, billed the customers, and collected payment. All of these facts, established at trial, reveal the drivers' deliveries were part of Sonic's regular business.
As to whether the parties believed they were creating an employer-employee relationship, Sonic contends its Contract with the drivers clearly established the drivers were independent contractors. However, the trial court rejected this claim on a variety of grounds.
The testimony at trial supports the trial court's critique of the evidence surrounding the Contract. Only one of the drivers who testified recalled signing a Contract. One of the drivers testified he drove without a Contract. Nor did Sonic enforce the Contracts. Drivers testified they did not, as the Contract requires, name Sonic as an additional insured on their insurance. Nor did the drivers obtain workers' compensation insurance as required by the Contract. In addition, the drivers testified Sonic failed to explain the legal and practical impacts of the Contract.
The evidence presented at trial supports the trial court's conclusion that the drivers operated as Sonic's employees in delivering packages. The testimony at trial revealed Sonic exerted control over the drivers to coordinate and supervise the company's basic function: timely delivery of packages. The secondary factors also point to a finding of employee status.[3]</p>

<p>48
*48 IV

Finally, Sonic argues the trial court abused its discretion in holding it liable for penalties under section 1127. Section 1127 authorizes the Department's director to impose a 10 percent penalty if an employer fails to comply with the contributions provisions of the code. The trial court found Sonic failed to meet its burden of proof on the question of refunds for penalties.
Sonic argues it acted in good faith in classifying the drivers as independent contractors. To support this assertion, Sonic essentially reargues the evidence in support of a finding of independent contractor status. Sonic reiterates the independent contractor status bestowed by the Contracts and argues Millsap supports its conclusion that the drivers were independent contractors.
The trial court considered the Contracts and all other indicia relating to the employment relationship between Sonic and the drivers. The trial court found the evidence adduced at trial clearly and unequivocally supported the Department's claim that the drivers operated as Sonic employees. Our review of the record supports the trial court's conclusion that the drivers were properly classified as employees for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of Sonic's request for refund of penalties imposed under section 1127.</p>

<p>DISPOSITION

The judgment is affirmed. The Department shall recover costs on appeal.
SCOTLAND, P.J., and DAVIS, J., concur.
[1] All further statutory references are to the Unemployment Insurance Code.
[2] The court also noted a six-factor test developed in other jurisdictions to determine independent contractor status in light of the remedial purposes of workers' compensation legislation. Those factors include: the worker's opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill; the worker's investment in equipment or materials, or employment of helpers; whether the service rendered requires a special skill; the permanence of the working relationship; and whether the service rendered is an integral part of the employer's business. The court noted "there are many points of individual similarity between these guidelines and our own traditional Restatement tests. [Citation.] We find that all are logically pertinent to the inherently difficult determination whether a provider of service is an employee or an excluded independent contractor for purposes of workers' compensation law." (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 354-355, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399.)
[3] We reject Sonic's claim that Millsap v. Federal Express Corp. (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 425, 277 Cal.Rptr. 807 (Millsap) necessitates a finding that the drivers were independent contractors. In Millsap, a driver collided with a car and the injured passenger sued both the driver and the express company for which he was delivering packages. (Id. at pp. 428-429, 277 Cal.Rptr. 807.) Millsap considered whether an employment relationship existed for tort purposes, not for taxation or compensation purposes. The Millsap court concluded the driver was an independent contractor, based in part on the fact that he was paid on a per route, "piecemeal" basis whenever he submitted invoices. (Id. at p. 432, 277 Cal.Rptr. 807.) The court concluded that each time the driver picked up a package for delivery, there was a new "contract." (Id. at p. 432, fn. 3, 277 Cal.Rptr. 807.) Here, in contrast, drivers testified they received their pay on regularly scheduled paydays. In addition, unlike in Millsap, the drivers in the present case drove regular routes and worked regular schedules. In sum, because of the context and its sufficiently distinguishable facts, Millsap does not dictate a finding that Sonic's drivers were independent contractors.</p>

Fernando RUIZ, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
AFFINITY LOGISTICS CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 12-56589.
United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Submitted February 22, 2013.[*]
Filed June 16, 2014.
1095
*1095 Daniel A. Osborn, Osborn Law, P.C., New York, NY, for Plaintiff-Appellant.
James H. Hanson, Scopelitis, Garvin, Light, Hanson & Feary, P.C., Indianapolis, IN, for Defendant-Appellee.
Before: HARRY PREGERSON and RICHARD A. PAEZ, Circuit Judges, and JAMES P. JONES, District Judge.[**]</p>

<p>OPINION

PREGERSON, Circuit Judge:
This is the second time this case is before us. Plaintiff-Appellant Ruiz and putative class members (collectively, "drivers") are California residents who worked for Defendant-Appellee Affinity Logistics ("Affinity"), a Georgia corporation. Drivers allege that Affinity wrongfully classified them as independent contractors; failed to pay them sick leave, vacation, holiday, and severance wages; and improperly charged them workers' compensation insurance fees. The outcome of these state law causes of action depends on whether the drivers were employees or independent contractors of Affinity.
This case first came before us after the district court, following a three-day bench trial in December 2009, held that the drivers
1096
*1096 were independent contractors under Georgia law. Ruiz appealed. On February 8, 2012, in Ruiz v. Affinity Logistics Corporation ("Affinity I"), 667 F.3d 1318, 1325 (9th Cir.2012), we concluded that California law, not Georgia law, applies to the independent contractor versus employee question in this case, and remanded the matter to the district court. On remand, the parties agreed that no further evidence was necessary. The district court ordered the parties to submit briefs arguing their respective contentions under California law. Based on these briefs and the December 2009 bench trial record, the district court, on August 27, 2012, issued a memorandum decision and order concluding that, under California law, the drivers were independent contractors.
Ruiz timely appealed the district court's judgment on remand. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ¤ 1291. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>

<p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The following facts are undisputed.

A. Affinity's Hiring of Ruiz

Fernando Ruiz previously worked as a driver for Penske Logistics Corporation, a furniture delivery company that had a contract with Sears. His job status was that of an "employee." When Sears terminated its contract with Penske in November 2003, Sears advised the drivers that Affinity Logistics Corporation ("Affinity"), a company providing home delivery services for various home furnishing retailers,[1] would take over Penske's contract. Sears advised Ruiz and other drivers employed by Penske to speak with Danny Hansen, an Affinity manager, about working for Affinity.
Hansen told Ruiz and the other drivers that if they wished to be hired by Affinity, they had to become independent contractors. Specifically, Hansen told the drivers they needed a fictitious business name, a business license, and a commercial checking account. Affinity then advised the drivers on how to complete the necessary forms. Affinity went so far as to complete the forms for Ruiz, leaving only the spaces for his signature blank. With Affinity's help, Ruiz formed R & S Logistics ("R & S"). Ruiz obtained a Federal Employer Identification Number and a separate business banking account for R & S.
Additionally, to work for Affinity, each driver was required to sign an Independent Truckman's Agreement ("ITA") and Equipment Lease Agreement ("ELA"). The ITA and the ELA included clauses stating that the parties were entering into an independent contractor relationship. The ITA and ELA stated:
Control and Exclusive Use. . . . The parties intend to create an independent contractor relationship and not an employer-employee relationship.
Independent Contractor
(a) Contractor,[2] in the performance of this Agreement, will be acting in his own separate capacity and not as an agent, employee, partner, joint venture or associate of Affinity. It is expressly understood and agreed that Contractor is an independent contractor of Affinity in all manners and respects and that Contractor is not authorized to bind Affinity to any liability or obligation or to represent that it has any authority. . . .
The ITA was a one-year contract that automatically renewed from year to year. The contract could be terminated at any
1097
*1097 time by either party without cause upon giving the other party sixty days notice, or with cause upon breach of contract. The ITA set out the drivers' rate of pay, which, regardless of experience, was a flat "per stop" rate of $23.00 in 2004. The ITA also included a provision that a driver "at [Affinity's] option, may be transferred to another location then being served by [Affinity]," and a driver's failure to comply with a transfer would be a breach of the ITA.
After Ruiz and the other drivers signed the ITA and ELA, the drivers received an Affinity Contractor Procedures Manual ("Procedures Manual"). The Procedures Manual, prepared by Affinity, outlined procedures drivers were required to follow regarding loading trucks, delivering goods, installing goods, interacting with customers, reporting to Affinity after deliveries, and addressing returns and refused merchandise, damaged goods, and checking in with Affinity after deliveries. The Procedures Manual included mandatory language such as "must," "will report," "must contact," "required," "not acceptable," "100 percent adherence," and "exactly as specified."
Affinity hired Ruiz as a driver in 2003. Ruiz worked for Affinity from November 2003 to October 2004. Ruiz and the other drivers were responsible for loading furniture and appliance deliveries, unloading the deliveries, and installing the deliveries. Affinity did not require that drivers obtain special licenses. Nor did Affinity require that drivers have any specific work experience or training; rather, drivers simply had to have a driver's license, sign the ITA and ELA, and pass a drug test and physical exam.</p>

<p>B. Affinity's Regulation of Its Drivers

Drivers regularly worked about five to seven days per week. An Affinity employee would call the drivers each day to tell them whether or not they were working the following day. Drivers had a fairly regular rate of pay since they worked five to seven shifts per week, and every route had approximately eight deliveries. Drivers had to request time off three to four weeks in advance, and Affinity had discretion to deny those requests. Affinity denied requests for time off when it decided the delivery schedule was too busy.
Affinity encouraged, if not required, drivers to lease trucks from Affinity. All but one driver in the San Diego area leased their trucks from Affinity. Affinity automatically deducted $350 per week from a driver's paycheck to pay for the leased truck. Drivers were required to paint their trucks white, and could not put signs on their trucks. The trucks had a Sears logo and Affinity's name and motor carrier number on the door. Most drivers drove the same truck every day. Affinity handled upkeep of trucks and arranged for loaner trucks when trucks broke down, deducting these costs from drivers' pay.
Affinity required drivers to stock their trucks with certain supplies, as outlined in the Procedures Manual. These supplies included appliance and furniture totes, plastic mattress return bags, protective blankets, pads, tie-down straps, and tools including a level, power drill, and drill bits. Affinity required that drivers use a specific type of mobile telephone. Affinity supplied the phones and deducted monthly costs for the phones from drivers' paychecks. Affinity also required each driver to have a "helper" or secondary driver on the truck with them. Helpers had to submit to a background check and be approved by Affinity.
While working for Affinity, at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. everyday, drivers were required to report to the San Diego Market Delivery Operation ("MDO") warehouse where Affinity's offices were located. When drivers
1098
*1098 arrived at the MDO, they had to report to one of the supervisors and pick up their route manifests, which told them how many deliveries they had that day and where the deliveries were. Drivers then checked to make sure they had all the furniture and appliances to be delivered.
Next, as outlined in the Procedures Manual, Affinity required drivers and helpers to attend a fifteen to thirty minute "stand-up" meeting at 7:15 a.m. The stand-up meeting was led by an Affinity supervisor. The Affinity supervisor would review the drivers' customer satisfaction survey scores from previous deliveries, discuss problems encountered in recent deliveries, and discuss any other issues Affinity thought would be "beneficial to help [drivers] out in the field."
Drivers were required to wear uniforms and abide by certain grooming requirements, as set forth in the "Delivery Team Apparel and Appearance" section of the Procedures Manual. The uniform consisted of an "industrial light blue [shirt] with blue stripe, American flag on sleeve, emblem with `Sears-Authorized Delivery'"; black pants; a belt without a metal buckle; and "industrial, black leather shoes" ordered from a particular company, Lehigh Safety Shoes. Drivers had to keep their shoes "neat and clean." Affinity provided the uniforms, but charged drivers for them by deducting the costs from drivers' paychecks. Affinity also required that tattoos and piercings be covered or removed and that facial hair be "neatly groomed and properly shaved surrounding the beard." Affinity provided shaving kits to drivers with facial hair that did not meet Affinity's grooming requirements.
After each morning stand-up meeting, Affinity required that Hansen or Jimmy Starnes, another Affinity supervisor, check the drivers' trucks to ensure that drivers had the required tools, that deliveries were loaded with the necessary padding and properly secured, and that no appliances were left on the dock. The supervisors also checked that the drivers were in their required uniform and properly groomed.
Drivers made deliveries according to the route manifests Affinity provided to them daily. Drivers could not control the order of deliveries; they were instructed in the Procedures Manual to maintain "100 percent adherence" to the manifests created by Affinity. The assignment of routes was based on scores drivers received from Sears's customer surveys known as the Quality Measurement/Incentive Program. Drivers with higher scores selected their routes first, while drivers with lower scores were given the least desirable routes.
Affinity required drivers to call an automated Sears customer service number after each delivery; this requirement is listed in the Procedures Manual as "a very important requirement." During these calls, drivers would report the stop number that was just completed, the arrival time, and departure time. Throughout the day, drivers also had to contact an Affinity supervisor after every two or three deliveries. When a driver did not call, Affinity would call the driver to find out the driver's location. If a driver was running late, Affinity would call Sears to inform them that Affinity had "a driver running late." Affinity supervisors also monitored the progress of each driver throughout the day on a "route monitoring screen," and would contact a driver if they noticed he or she was running late or off-course.
Affinity also engaged in "follow-alongs," whereby an Affinity supervisor followed a driver for a few stops to ensure that the driver was wearing the uniform and using proper delivery techniques. Sometimes the Affinity supervisor would talk to a customer after a delivery to evaluate the driver's performance. Occasionally, for
1099
*1099 heavier loads, the Affinity supervisor would also assist the driver in a delivery.
After drivers completed their daily delivery routes, they returned to the warehouse to park their trucks. At the end of the day, drivers were required to fill out a form (also known as a "cover sheet"), and return the route manifest to Affinity. Drivers left the trucks and the keys for the trucks at the MDO warehouse. Affinity admitted that it "strongly discouraged" drivers from taking the trucks home or otherwise removing trucks from the warehouse lot overnight or on weekends. Moreover, Affinity sometimes used the drivers' trucks for other jobs. Drivers were told to leave their keys at the MDO "just in case they need that truck to run another load with somebody else." Affinity did not compensate drivers for the use of their trucks for these other deliveries.</p>

<p>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Ruiz's claims  Affinity's wrongfully classifying the drivers as independent contractors; Affinity failing to pay drivers sick leave, vacation, holiday, and severance wages; and Affinity improperly charging drivers for workers' compensation insurance[3]  turn on whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees of Affinity. After a three-day bench trial in December 2009, the district court concluded that Georgia law applied to the independent contractor/employee question and that Ruiz was an independent contractor under Georgia law. Ruiz appealed the district court's ruling.
On February 8, 2012, in Affinity I, we held that California law, not Georgia law, applies and remanded the matter to the district court to apply California law. See Affinity I, 667 F.3d at 1325. On remand, the district court filed a memorandum decision and order on August 27, 2012, holding that, under California law, the drivers were independent contractors rather than employees of Affinity. The district court based its findings on evidence from the December 2009 bench trial and arguments made by the parties in their briefs following remand.[4]
Ruiz timely appealed the district court's August 27, 2012 memorandum decision and order.</p>

<p>STANDARD OF REVIEW

The California Supreme Court has held that the standard of review for the employee versus independent contractor question under California law may be de novo or clear error, depending on whether the facts are disputed:
The determination of employee or independent-contractor status is one of fact if dependent upon the resolution of disputed evidence or inferences, and the Division [of Labor Standards Enforcement]'s decision must be upheld if substantially supported. If the evidence is undisputed, the question becomes one of law, but deference to the agency's view is appropriate.
S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Dep't of Industrial Relations ("Borello"), 48 Cal.3d 341, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399, 403 (1989) (citations omitted).
This case requires us to address the independent contractor versus employee question under California law. Because
1100
*1100 the parties do not dispute the operative facts, the standard of review is de novo under Borello. Thus, we review de novo the district court's legal conclusion that the drivers were independent contractors. We review, however, the district court's underlying factual findings following a bench trial for clear error. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6); Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Entm't Distrib., 429 F.3d 869, 879 (9th Cir.2005). A finding is clearly erroneous if we are "left with the `definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'" Id. (quoting Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 242, 121 S.Ct. 1452, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001)); United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1260-61 (9th Cir. 2009).</p>

<p>DISCUSSION

"[U]nder California law, once a plaintiff comes forward with evidence that he provided services for an employer, the [plaintiff] has established a prima facie case that the relationship was one of employer/employee." Narayan v. EGL, Inc., 616 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir.2010). The burden then shifts to the employer to "prove, if it can, that the presumed employee was an independent contractor." Id. (citing Cristler v. Express Messenger Sys., Inc., 171 Cal.App.4th 72, 89 Cal. Rptr.3d 34, 43-44 (2009)). Because Ruiz has shown that he provided services for Affinity, the burden shifts to Affinity to demonstrate, if it can, that Ruiz and the other drivers were independent contractors, not employees.
The California Supreme Court has explained that to determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor, a court should evaluate "[e]ach service arrangement . . . on its facts, and the dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case." See Borello, 256 Cal. Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 407. The Borello court, however, also provided a number of factors that should guide courts in making that determination. First, the Borello court stated that "the right to control work details is the most important or most significant consideration." Id., 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 404 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tieberg v. Unemp't Ins. Appeals Bd., 2 Cal.3d 943, 88 Cal.Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975, 977 (1970) (holding that "[t]he principal test of an employment relationship is whether the person to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired"); Estrada v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 154 Cal.App.4th 1, 64 Cal. Rptr.3d 327, 335 (2007) ("The essence of the test is the `control of details'  that is, whether the principal has the right to control the manner and means by which the worker accomplishes the work. . . .").
In Borello, the California Supreme Court also explained that additional, "secondary" factors may be relevant in making that determination:
These include (a) whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be performed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) whether or not the work is part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee.

[these] individual factors cannot be applied mechanically as separate tests; they are intertwined and their weight depends often on particular combinations." Germann v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 123 Cal. App.3d 776, 176 Cal.Rptr. 868, 871 (1981). Regarding the final secondary factor, the California Court of Appeal has noted that the label that parties place on their employment relationship "is not dispositive and will be ignored if their actual conduct establishes a different relationship." Estrada, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 335.
As we explain below, contrary to the district court's conclusion, the totality of the undisputed facts indicate that the drivers were Affinity's employees rather than independent contractors.</p>

<p>A. Primary Factor: Affinity Had the Right to Control the Details of the Drivers' Work

In Borello, the California Supreme Court "emphasize[d] that the [defendant] growers, though purporting to relinquish supervision of the harvest work itself, retained absolute overall control of . . . [a]ll meaningful aspects of this business relationship: price, crop cultivation, fertilization and insect prevention, payment, [and] right to deal with buyers. . . ." 256 Cal. Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 407-08 (third and fourth alterations in original) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). In these circumstances, the court concluded, the defendant "retains all necessary control over the harvest portion of its operations." Id., 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 408; see also JKH Enters., Inc. v. Dep't of Indus. Relations, 142 Cal.App.4th 1046, 48 Cal.Rptr.3d 563, 579 (2006) (holding that "[b]y obtaining the clients in need of the service and providing the workers to conduct it, [delivery company defendant] retained all necessary control over the operation as a whole").
Here, the undisputed facts indicate that Affinity had the right to control the details of the drivers' work, and that Affinity retained all necessary control over the drivers' work. Like defendant FedEx in Estrada, a case where the California Court of Appeal held that FedEx delivery drivers were employees, Affinity controlled the drivers' rates, schedules, and routes. 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 336. Affinity set the drivers' flat "per stop" rate; the drivers could not negotiate for higher rates, as independent contractors commonly can. See Borello, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 409-10. Affinity decided the days drivers worked, and retained the discretion to deny drivers' requests for days off. Affinity determined routes, and instructed drivers not to deviate from the order of deliveries listed on the route manifests Affinity created.
Like FedEx in Estrada, Affinity also controlled the equipment  the trucks, tools, and mobile phones  and the helpers the drivers used. See Estrada, 64 Cal. Rptr.3d at 336 (holding that drivers were FedEx's employees in part because "[t]he larger items  trucks and scanners  are obtained from FedEx approved providers, [are] usually financed through FedEx, and [are] repaid through deductions from the drivers' weekly checks").
Affinity controlled the appearance of the drivers by requiring that drivers wear uniforms and by prohibiting drivers from wearing earrings, displaying tattoos, and sporting certain designs of facial hair. The district court recognized that Affinity regulated the drivers' uniforms and appearance, but dismissed these measures of control as "driven by a need to comply with federal regulations or with Sears' requirements." But, in Estrada, the California Court of Appeal "summarily reject[ed]
1102
*1102 FedEx's suggestion that [uniform and grooming] constraints such as these are necessary to ensure the drivers' compliance with government regulations." 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 336 n. 9; see also Borello, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 409 n. 13 (rejecting defendant's argument that because defendant's customers made defendant adopt the contract with its migrant workers, the contract should not be considered as evidence of control). The Estrada court noted that "FedEx's control over every exquisite detail of the drivers' performance, including the color of their socks and the style of their hair, supports the. . . conclusion that the drivers are employees, not independent contractors." 64 Cal. Rptr.3d at 336. This case presents similar undisputed facts concerning Affinity's control over "every exquisite detail" of the drivers' appearance, including the "color of their socks" and "the style of their hair."[5]
Affinity also closely monitored and supervised its drivers. Each morning, Affinity required drivers to report to the warehouse, where Affinity had several offices, and attend the stand-up meeting. This requirement, as the district court correctly acknowledged, shows that Affinity exercised "some degree of control" over the drivers' start times. See Estrada, 64 Cal. Rptr.3d at 337 (holding that drivers were employees in part because "drivers . . . must be at the terminal at regular times for sorting and packing as well as mandatory meetings, and they may not leave until the process is completed"). Affinity continued to monitor the drivers by inspecting their appearance and loading of their trucks; conducting "follow-alongs"; requiring that drivers call their Affinity supervisor after every two or three stops; monitoring the progress of each driver on the "route monitoring screen"; and contacting drivers if Affinity noticed drivers were running late or off course.
Finally, the provisions of the ITA and the Procedures Manual demonstrate that Affinity retained the right to control its drivers. The ITA sets out the drivers' rate of pay, allows Affinity to terminate drivers without cause with sixty days notice, and allows Affinity to transfer drivers to other locations. And, as the district court recognized, the guidelines contained in the Procedures Manual "were more than mere `suggestions.'" The Procedures Manual outlined the above-described procedures that Affinity required its drivers to follow, including wearing uniforms, loading trucks, delivering goods, and reporting to Affinity after deliveries.
The district court held that Affinity did not have the right to control the details of the drivers' work almost entirely based on one fact: the drivers could hire helpers and secondary drivers. But the district court overlooked the fact that often the reason drivers hired helpers was that they were required to do so by Affinity. Further, like defendant FedEx in Estrada, Affinity retained ultimate discretion to approve or disapprove of those helpers and additional drivers. See id. at 337. While the district court found that approval was largely based upon neutral factors, such as background checks required under federal regulations, it is still true that the drivers did not have an unrestricted right to choose these persons, which is an "important right[] [that] would normally inure to
1103
*1103 a self-employed contractor." See Borello, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 408 n. 9 (holding that a contract provision restricting sharefarmers' right to choose employees evidenced defendant's right to control sharefarmers).
Although Affinity did not require their drivers to obtain additional drivers, the testimony at trial indicated that the impetus for doing so came from Affinity whenever it had additional need for such drivers, rather than any desire by the drivers to profit from such hiring. Moreover, any additional drivers were subject to the same degree of control exerted by Affinity over the drivers generally.
In any event, the district court's reliance on this factor as dispositive in light of the overwhelming evidence of Affinity's control over its drivers was error. Like Estrada, Borello, and JKH Enterprises, Inc., the undisputed facts in this case show that Affinity retained all necessary control over the drivers' work. While "purporting to relinquish" some control to the drivers by making the drivers form their own businesses and hire helpers, Affinity "retained absolute overall control" over the key parts of the business. See Borello, 48 Cal.3d at 355-56, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399. This control included much more than obtaining clients and providing workers, which the JKH Enterprises, Inc. court found sufficient to establish right of control. 48 Cal.Rptr.3d at 579. Affinity retained absolute control over drivers' rates, payment, routes, schedules, trucks, equipment, appearance, decision to hire helpers, choice of helpers, and the right to deal with customers. In light of Estrada, Borello, and JHK Enterprises, Inc., the district court's contrary conclusion  that Affinity did not exercise sufficient control over the drivers' work  was in error.
We also note Affinity's relationship with its drivers is very different from the relationship between the parties in State Compensation Insurance Fund v. Brown, 32 Cal.App.4th 188, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 98 (1995), where the California Court of Appeal found that the truck driver plaintiffs were independent contractors. There, the truck driver plaintiffs worked for more than one broker at a time, had "complete control over their working conditions and the manner in which a load was transported (including whether or not to hire assistants)," and were "entirely free to accept or reject an assignment without reprisal." Id. at 105. Unlike in State Compensation Insurance Fund, where the defendant's "participation is limited to offering the assignments and paying compensation upon proof of delivery," here, as described above, Affinity regulated many details of the drivers' work, including working conditions and the manner in which drivers made their deliveries. See id.
Thus, the most important factor under the Borello analysis  right to control  indicates overwhelmingly that the drivers were Affinity's employees.</p>

<p>B. Secondary Factors

Moreover, most of the secondary factors outlined in Borello also point to the conclusion that the drivers were employees. Borello, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 404; see also JKH Enters., Inc., 48 Cal.Rptr.3d at 579 n. 14.
(1) Distinct occupation or business: Although the district court recognized that the drivers would not have formed their own businesses in the absence of Affinity's requirement that they do so, the district court stated that "[r]egardless of the motive for forming their businesses . . . Plaintiffs ultimately had the ability to expand their businesses by hiring more employees, operating multiple trucks, and making managerial decisions regarding the employment and performances of the employees hired." The district court clearly
1104
*1104 erred by not giving enough weight to the fact that Affinity required drivers to create these businesses as a condition of employment. Affinity even helped drivers set up the businesses by filling out necessary paperwork.
Moreover, in the real world, these businesses were in name only. The drivers' only business was with Affinity because the drivers could not use their trucks for any purpose other than their work for Affinity. Affinity admitted that it "strongly discouraged" drivers from removing trucks from the warehouse lot overnight or on weekends. And, as the district court found, "Affinity would on occasion allow other drivers to use their trucks to make deliveries on days the drivers were not operating their trucks themselves. Plaintiffs were not compensated for this use."
(2) Work under principal's direction or by specialist without supervision: The district court emphasized that the drivers' work included not only driving but also the delivery and installation of the appliances, and that the delivery and installation work "requires substantial skill" and was unsupervised. But in hiring drivers, Affinity did not require special driving licenses or even any work experience; rather a driver simply had to have a driver's license, sign a work agreement, and pass a physical examination and drug test. These facts parallel Estrada, where the court found that FedEx drivers "need no experience to get the job in the first place and [the] only required skill is the ability to drive." 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 337. Moreover, as explained above, Affinity closely supervised the drivers' work through various methods. The district court therefore clearly erred when it concluded that the drivers were specialists without supervision.
(3) Skill required: As described above, the drivers' work did not require substantial skill.
(4) Provision of instrumentalities, tools, and place of work: As the district court found, "[t]he delivery truck was the main tool [that] Plaintiffs used to conduct their business." This main tool was provided by Affinity. Affinity advanced the drivers' costs of leasing and maintaining their trucks, and deducted these advances from drivers' paychecks. Affinity also required that drivers use a specific type of mobile phone, provided the drivers with these phones, and deducted the associated monthly costs from drivers' paychecks.
The district court recognized these leasing and cost-advancing arrangements, but reasoned that under these arrangements the drivers furnished their own tools because they ultimately paid for them. We find this conclusion to be clearly erroneous. Affinity supplied the drivers with the major tools of the job by encouraging or requiring that the drivers obtain the tools from them through paid leasing arrangements. Moreover, the drivers did not own the trucks or cell phones, but only leased them from Affinity to perform their work for Affinity.
(5) Method of payment: As the district court found, the drivers were paid per delivery. The district court recognized that construing each delivery as an independent "job" would be unrealistic because jobs are typically longer-term and, here, drivers made approximately eight deliveries per day. The district court nonetheless concluded that the payment scheme was closer to "by the job" rather than "by the hour" because "[t]here were no set hours to the day, nor did each delivery take the same amount of time, even though the amount paid essentially remained the same." But the district court's findings that drivers made approximately eight deliveries per day and the amount paid to each driver "essentially remained the same," lead to the conclusion that, although
1105
*1105 labeled "by the delivery," the drivers were essentially paid by a regular rate of pay. See Estrada, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 335 (finding that the fact that drivers "are paid weekly, not by the job" weighs in favor of employee status).
(6) Parties' belief: Ruiz and Affinity understood their relationship to be an independent contractor arrangement. As the California Court of Appeal has noted, however, "the parties' label is not dispositive and will be ignored if their actual conduct establishes a different relationship." Estrada, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d at 336 (citing Borello, 256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d at 403).
(7) Right to terminate at will: As the district court concluded, the parties' mutual termination provision is consistent with either an employer-employee or independent contractor relationship.
(8) Work part of principal's regular business: Affinity, by its own definition, is an "experienced and competent home delivery contractor [that] desires to perform home delivery services." (emphasis added). As the district court recognized, Affinity's drivers perform those very home delivery services that are the core of Affinity's regular business. Without drivers, Affinity could not be in the home delivery business.
(9) Length of time for performance of services: As the district court explained, "there was no contemplated end to the service relationship" when Affinity and the drivers signed their contracts, and drivers often stayed with Affinity for years.
Because Affinity had the right to control the details of the drivers' work, and because the totality of the secondary factors weigh in favor of the drivers, under California's Borello test, the drivers are employees of Affinity rather than independent contractors.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION

The undisputed facts indicate that Affinity had the right to control the details of the drivers' work, and the application of the secondary factors weigh in favor of a finding that the drivers were employees. We therefore reverse the district court's decision that the drivers were independent contractors and hold that they were Affinity's employees under California law. We remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. Costs shall be awarded to Ruiz.
REVERSED and REMANDED.
[*] The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).
[**] The Honorable James P. Jones, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, sitting by designation.
[1] Affinity describes itself as an "experienced and competent home delivery contractor [that] desires to perform home delivery services."
[2] The ITA and ELA repeatedly referred to the drivers as "Contractors."
[3] Ruiz also alleged a claim for overtime pay, but on June 5, 2008, the district court granted Affinity's motion for summary judgment as to this claim. Ruiz does not appeal that ruling.
[4] At a March 28, 2012 hearing, the district court asked the parties whether they wanted to introduce additional evidence. According to the district court, "[t]he parties represented that no further evidence was necessary, and that the case would not need to be retried." Neither party asked to submit additional evidence.
[5] The district court also erred by emphasizing that the rules regarding the drivers' appearance were "intended to ensure customer security rather than control the driver." (internal quotation marks omitted). In doing so, the district court misunderstood the Borello test. The district court incorporated a subjective requirement when it dismissed Affinity's appearance requirements as not motivated by Affinity's intent to control its drivers. Whether Affinity intended to control the drivers does not matter under Borello; what matters only is whether Affinity had the right to control the drivers' work.</p>
